                    <p>League of Legends is a 5v5 MOBA developed by Riot Games in 2009 and played by millions daily around the world. Thanks to the massive playerbase and Riot's detailed 
                        API, websites by developers cropped up across the globe, pulling data and providing the hungry playerbase much-needed analysis. KARAN.GG is one of these, 
                        however it has key differences that seperates it from the competition. 
                        <br><br>
                        Although KARAN.GG began as a simple side project, it quickly became much more than just a simple stat tracker and data puller. Using RIOT's API, 
                        KARAN.GG pulls standard information about players, matches, champions, etc. from their League of Legends games. However, it differs in what information
                        it presents to the player. Unlike other stat-tracking websites, KARAN.GG provides statistics and information from recent games instead of a players entire 
                        history, giving the player more relevant information. KARAN.GG also allows the user the specify specific gamemodes and check their winrates with duo partners,
                        something no other tracker has. With numerous other unique features, KARAN.GG is a powerful tool that helps players win more games. To test the power
                        of this service, try some of the sample data or enter your own data.
