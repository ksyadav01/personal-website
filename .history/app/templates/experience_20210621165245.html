                        <br><br>GCOM Software is a company specializing in developing software solutions to a customer's problems.
                         While at GCOM, I developed a software that pulled raw employee data, parsed through said data, and emailed
                         employees when specific conditions were fulfilled. When I was at the job site, I attended business meetings 
                         with clients and gained experience with the non-programming aspects of a software engineering job. 
                         Both on and off site, I heavily researched data structures and databases and learned how to pull data from them.
                         From my time at GCOM, I also gained familiarity with database systems and maven repositories, allong with Spring 
                         Boot.

                        <br><br>As a TA, I lead weekly discussion sections of ~30 students and reviewed lecture material, taught new
                        material, and demonstrated various ways to solve practice problems. I also assisted students with programming
                        and debugging in MIPS Assembly, allong with showing how to use all the features of the MARS compiler. Every week
                        I hosted multiple office hours where I would review lessons from class, help with homework questions, and provide
                        any help that students needed. I also helped to develop and review homework assignments and exams. Managing our class's
                        Piazza forum was also another responsibility, and I assisted students with any problems there and through other platforms
                        including email, Discord, and Slack.

                        <br><br>One of my main responsibilities at Skechers is maintaining customer satisfaction, and I strive to make sure every 
                        customer had a positive experience. I greet every customer on entry and help with any questions or concerns they may have.
                        Another one of my primary responsibilities is setting up and arranging instore displays in accordance with new stock and 
                        clearing out all outdated inventory, allong with  operating the cash register. The Covid pandemic has made shopping very 
                        difficult for many people, and it is also my job to  maintaining a clean and sanitary working environment.
